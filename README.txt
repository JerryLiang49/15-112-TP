Project Name: Pac112Man (pacman + 112!)

Project Description:
This is a recreation of the classic arcade game, Pacman, in Python, utilizing CMU graphics.
If you aren’t familiar with Pacman, it’s a game where the player controls a character, Pacman, 
navigating through a maze. The objective is to eat all the pellets or dots scattered throughout 
the maze while avoiding the four colorful ghosts. The player starts with 3 lives and loses a life
each time Pacman collides with a ghost. The player loses the game if all lives are lost. The player 
wins the game if all pellets on the board are eaten. To make the game more fun and also easier, there
are various power ups scattered throughout the maze. The power ups include a power-up pellet that enables 
the player to eat the ghost, a speed boost, and a time freeze.
